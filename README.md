## The Task

You are required to build a SPA (Single page application) using any frontend framework (React JS preferred) which is a chat application.
Pages in the application :

### Chat Page

A chat page is a chat window where users can chat with the mirror chatbot (i.e. essentially a chatbot that sends back the user input).
An input field where the user can enter his message and a send button alongside to send the message.

A chat window where chat between user and chatbot is shown.

A header on top of the page with a chatbot image and name.
When a user sends a message in the chat view, the same message will be echoed back which will be shown as the response message from the mirror chatbot in the chat window.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
